# Web Scraping Homework - Mission to Mars

For this assignment, I built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to Mars. To accomplish this, first I had to develop the code to scrape the websites (after reviewing the sites, of course), then develop the flask app and html page to display the data. I used MongoDb to store the mars information every time the web scraping is performed from the app.

### Contents:
 - Jupyter notebook used to develop and test the web scraping code
 - Python code to define the scrape function
 - Python code to run the flask app and HTML page
 - HTML page within the templates folder that displays the scraped data (and runs the scrape function through the click of a button)
 

### Screenshots of the Web Application:
